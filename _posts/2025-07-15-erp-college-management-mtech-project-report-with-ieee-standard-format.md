Student Success Story – Real Testimonial from a Top College
-----------------------------------------------------------

“Honestly, I was struggling with my M.Tech final year project at NIT Surathkal. My coding wasn’t strong and I was worried about the IEEE format requirements. I downloaded this ERP College Management project from FileMakr.com just five days before my submission.  
  
The report had every diagram my professor asked for—ERD, DFDs, even a Gantt chart! During my viva, I was able to explain each module confidently because the documentation made it so clear. Ended up getting 91/100 on my project evaluation and my internal guide even commented on how ‘industry-ready’ my documentation looked.  
  
If you want zero stress in your final year—this is literally a lifesaver.”  
**– Priya Menon (M.Tech CSE), NIT Surathkal**
